    <h1>Terms of use</h1>
    <h2>You've got to play by the rules.</h2>
    <p>
        This website-based application, namely Amplio, is provided to the community as free and open-source software,
        licensed under the terms of the 'Do Whatever You Want' license. The authors of this poetic code (or rather,
        author), namely Dhruv Bhanushali, is not liable for any damages caused by the use of this innocent piece of
        code. In all adverse cases, the lack of intelligence of the using-party is to be blamed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 'Do Whatever You Want' license allows you to use, modify (your own copy, of course, for this one is mine),
        distribute for free or for a fee, promote, criticize (only positively), or do anything else your brain can
        conjure, as long as you ac responsibly and fairly. People may sue you and you'll bear the brunt without a single
        complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
        If any clause of the license seems objectionable to you, nobody cares. Go find another application like Amplio.
