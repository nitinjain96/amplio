# django-apps
This repository is a collection of Django web applications, made by me, [Dhruv Bhanushali](http://dhruvkb.github.io), a developer and engineer-physicist at the [Indian Institute of Technology at Roorkee](http://www.iitr.ac.in) in Uttarakhand, India.

I am a prolific member of [Information Management Group](http://img.channeli.in), the computing group of IIT credited with maintaining the technological backbone of the institute.

This repository is my summer assignment for learning web programming with Django.
